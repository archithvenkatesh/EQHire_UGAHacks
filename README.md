# ugahacks_EQHIRE

Team Members: Samar Kapoor, Archith Venkatesh, Andrew Nguyen

Purpose: In today's workforce, many minorities have long been underrepresented and subjected to unfair treatment, perpetuating systemic inequalities. At EQHire, we recognize this glaring disparity and have made it our mission to address it head-on. We understand that diversity is not just about numbers; it's about creating an environment where every individual feels valued, respected, and empowered to succeed. 

Tools: Python, Flask, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, ChatGPT API, Serp API, Javascript

Problems: We struggled with diverting work but were able to solve them through VSCode plugins. There was also some struggle with creating algorithms that generated good AI output while connecting that output to other APIs to return desired current job listings. Further, we had issues trying to connect frontend with backend that.
